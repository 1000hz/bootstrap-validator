# Validator, for Bootstrap 3
The Validator plugin offers automatic form validation configurable via mostly HTML5 standard attributes.
It also provides an unobtrusive user experience, because nobody likes a naggy form.

## Features
- Configurable via data-api and standard HTML5 attributes
- Patient to inform user of errors and eager to let them know the errors have been resolved
- Submit is disabled until the form is valid and all required fields are complete
- Customizable error messages
- Custom validator functions
- Validation of an input field via AJAX
